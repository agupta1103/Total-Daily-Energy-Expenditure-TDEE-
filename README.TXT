POST MORTEM REVIEW (PMR):
This coding assignment was actually very easy to complete and I finished
it in a breeze of time. Very straight forward, and simple coding. The only
difference was the incorporation of logical operators in the if-else-if
statements and the basic incorporation of string methods and double values.
